	<p> My name Savannah Gambel, and I was raised in Loretto, Tennessee, which is a small town right outside of North Alabama. My family owns and raises a large, black angus cattle farm, which has allowed me to become very active in agriculture. My father is a very active participant in the agricultural community, so through his dedication and involvement, I was able to learn and become very involved in in the agriculture field. I joined our local 4-H Livestock chapter as soon as I was eligible (4th grade) and became very involved with livestock judging, skill-a-thons, cattle shows, public speaking/demonstration competitions, and much more. By being very involved, I was able to see the opportunities the agricultural field actually had to offer, because in my town no one believed there was any opportunities, unless you were a large scale farmer. Therefore, when I was a senior in high school (2016), I was completely sure I wanted to graduate with a bachelor's degree and begin vet school, so that is why I decided to attend the University of Tennessee at Martin.I was very excited to be in the Animal Science program, and I still love being apart of it, but when I was taking my Public Speaking course my professor jokingly encouraged the whole class to switch our majors to Communications. I am the kind of person that thrives on trying new things, which is why I have taken a few random courses while in college. However,  I took this very differently than most students, and wanted to learn more about the communications field, since Martin is also known to have a great comm department. My junior year of college I began taking many communications classes, and enjoyed it to the point I wanted to double major, however, because of my heavy workload with already being an Animal Science major, I decided to minor in Communications. I have to say this was the best decision I have made so far in my college career, combing Animal Science and Communications allows you to see a better perspective of how the agricultural field works. Therefore, I am now a senior and plan to graduate in May, throughout these past three years I have been very involved with numerous clubs, a sorority, held many positions, and have contributed to the community with volunteer work. Once I graduate I am very open minded about moving, I have many skills and want to pursue my career within the Agricultural Communications department. Each summer of my college career I have worked and taken many summer classes, so I have not been able to have a real internship. Although, with the handful of jobs I have had, I know I am hard working, self dedicated, and a pretty good multitasker. Also despite working a regular job and taking classes, I also had the responsibility of upholding duties on my families' farm. Therefore, I know I can prove myself to a company and work my way up into this amazing industry if given the opportunity.</p>
